# ðŸ“‚ Part 11 - Advanced Course in Programming

This section contains my solutions to the exercises from **Part 11** of the MOOC.  
It introduces list comprehensions and recursions.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered:

1. [**List Comprehensions**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-11-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/1_List_Comprehensions): Understanding list comprehensions and being able to use them to create new lists.
2. [**More comprehensions**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-11-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/2_More_Comprehensions): Learning how to use comprehensions with strings, classes and dictionaries.
3. [**Recursion**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-11-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/3_Recursion): Understanding what recursion means and how to write simple recursive functions.
4. [**More recursion examples**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-11-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/4_More_Recursion_Examples): Learning about binary trees and recursive algorithms.

**Note**: This section is not fully completed yet. More exercises will be added later.

Each folder contains multiple exercises related to the topic.
