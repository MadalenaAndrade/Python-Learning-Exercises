# ðŸ“‚ Part 5 - Introducing to Programming

This section contains my solutions to the exercises from **Part 5** of the MOOC.  
It introduces advanced data structures like dictionaries and tuples, as well as important concepts like references and side effects in functions.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered:
1. [**More Lists**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-5-Introduction-to-Programming/1_More_Lists): Organizing data and working with two-dimensional lists.
2. [**References**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-5-Introduction-to-Programming/2_References): Understanding variable references and function side effects.
3. [**Dictionaries**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-5-Introduction-to-Programming/3_Dictionaries): Using key-value pairs and iterating through dictionaries.
4. [**Tuples**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-5-Introduction-to-Programming/4_Tuples): Immutable data structures and their use cases.


Each folder contains multiple exercises related to the topic.
