# ðŸ“‚ Part 10 - Advanced Course in Programming

This section contains my solutions to the exercises from **Part 10** of the MOOC.  
It introduces class hierarchies, access modifiers, and advanced object-oriented programming techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered:
1. [**Class Hierarchies**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-10-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/1_Class_Hierarchies): Understanding inheritance and how it affects class traits.
2. [**Access Modifiers**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-10-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/2_Objects_as_Attributes): Learning about private and protected attributes and their visibility in Python.
3. [**Encapsulation**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-10-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/3_OOP_Techniques): Exploring different uses of `self`, operator overloading, and creating iterable classes.

__Note__: This section is not fully completed yet. More exercises will be added later.

Each folder contains multiple exercises related to the topic.
