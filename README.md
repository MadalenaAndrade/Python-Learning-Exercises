# Python-Learning-Exercises
This repository contains the Python exercises I completed as part of a Python Programming MOOC. The goal of this project is to track my progress and showcase my journey learning programming!

## Starting with Part 4 in the course Introduction to Programming
I've decided to start sharing my journey from **Part 4** onwards because it's when I transitioned to using **Visual Studio Code** for my development environment. This part also marks the point where the exercises became more complex, moving beyond basic programming concepts.

Feel free to explore and follow my progress as I continue to learn and grow!
