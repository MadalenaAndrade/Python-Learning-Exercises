# Python-Learning-Exercises
This repository contains the Python exercises I completed as part of a Python Programming MOOC. The goal of this project is to **track my progress** and **showcase my journey** learning programming!

## ðŸš€ About This Repository
- The exercises in this repository were completed **without access to solutions** until I passed all required tests.  
- This means each solution is entirely my own, developed through problem-solving and debugging.  

## ðŸ“Œ Why I Started from Part 4
I've decided to start sharing my journey from **Part 4** onwards because it's when I transitioned to using **Visual Studio Code** for my development environment. This part also marks the point where the exercises became more complex, moving beyond basic programming concepts.

## ðŸ“‚ Course Progress
I have organized my solutions into folders based on different parts of the course.
