# ðŸ“‚ Part 6 - Introducing to Programming

This section contains my solutions to the exercises from **Part 6** of the MOOC.  
It introduces file handling (reading and writing files), error management, and variable scope, which are essential concepts for building more robust Python programs.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered:
1. [**Reading Files**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-6-Introduction-to-Programming/1_Reading_files): Working with text and CSV files.
2. [**Writing Files**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-6-Introduction-to-Programming/2_Writing_files): Creating and saving data to files.
3. [**Handling Errors**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-6-Introduction-to-Programming/3_Handling_errors): Understanding and managing exceptions.


Each folder contains multiple exercises related to the topic.
