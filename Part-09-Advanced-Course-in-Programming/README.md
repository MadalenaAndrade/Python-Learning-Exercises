# ðŸ“‚ Part 9 - Advanced Course in Programming

This section contains my solutions to the exercises from **Part 9** of the MOOC.  
It explores more advanced concepts of object-oriented programming, including object references, encapsulation, and class attributes.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered:
1. [**Objects and References**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-09-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/1_Objects_References): Using different data structures to handle objects and passing objects as arguments.
2. [**Objects as Attributes**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-09-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/2_Classes_as_attributes): Using objects as attributes within other objects and understanding the None keyword.
3. [**Encapsulation**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-09-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/3_Encapsulation): Creating private attributes and implementing getters and setters.
4. [**Scope of Methods**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-09-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/4_Scope_of_Methods): Controlling method visibility and writing private methods.
5. [**Class Attributes**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-09-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/5_Class_Attributes): Understanding class variables, class methods, and static traits.
6. [**More Examples with Classes**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-09-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/6_More_Examples): Exploring additional class examples and using default parameter values.

Each folder contains multiple exercises related to the topic.
