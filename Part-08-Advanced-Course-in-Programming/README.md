# ðŸ“‚ Part 8 - Advanced Course in Programming

This section contains my solutions to the exercises from **Part 8** of the MOOC.  
It introduces fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, including creating classes, instantiating objects, and encapsulation.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered:
1. [**Objects and Methods**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-08-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/1_Objects_Methods): Understanding objects, their independence, and how to create and access them.
2. [**Classes and Objects**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-08-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/2_Classes_Objects): Understanding the relationship between classes and objects.
3. [**Defining Classes**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-08-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/3_Defining_classes): Creating classes, attributes, and constructor methods.
4. [**Defining Methods**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-08-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/4_Defining_methods): Writing methods to manipulate objects and understanding encapsulation.
5. [**More Examples of Classes**](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises/tree/main/Part-08-Advanced-Course-in-Programming/5_More_examples_classes): Creating more versatile classes and using the `__str__` method.

Each folder contains multiple exercises related to the topic.
